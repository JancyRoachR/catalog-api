'''
Contains unit tests for the base Sierra app. Since we want to test
each model against the live database, and there are a lot of models, we
have test generators attached to each TestCase child class as class
methods, which are triggered when this file is imported. The test
generators create individual test methods as appropriate and then
attach them to the class using setattr().

    Tests all Sierra models to make sure they map to existing database

    possible that III will change the structure of the public Sierra
    views when they update their software, which will break our models.
    A given model may not be implemented in any other way, so we can't
    necessarily rely on other functional tests. These tests should be
